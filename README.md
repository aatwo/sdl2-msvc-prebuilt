# sdl2-msvc-prebuilt
Prebuilt static and dynamic SDL2 libraries for MSVC x64 using Visual Studio 17 2022.

# Build instructions
All libraries were built by opening and upgrading the provided VisualC Visual Studio project files in Visual Studio 2022 and building from there. They can be built using CMake but I found that to be a much more painful process.
